-- STEP 1: Identify admin user IDs first
-- =====================================================

-- Create temporary table to store admin user IDs
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE admin_users AS
SELECT DISTINCT u.id 
FROM users u
JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.id
WHERE r.is_admin = TRUE;

-- =====================================================

-- Clean positions completely
DELETE FROM positions WHERE 1=1;

DELETE FROM trade_history WHERE 1=1;

DELETE FROM trading_accounts WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM admin_users);

-- =====================================================

DELETE FROM user_settings WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM admin_users);

-- Delete user addresses for non-admin users
DELETE FROM user_addresses WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM admin_users);

-- Delete non-admin users
DELETE FROM users WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM admin_users);

DROP TEMPORARY TABLE admin_users;
