## üéØ Commission Calculation

```
Trade Volume = Lot Size √ó Contract Size √ó Close Price
Total Commission = Trade Volume √ó Commission Rate
IB Amount = Total Commission √ó (IB Share % / 100)
Admin Amount = Total Commission - IB Amount
```

### Example:
- Trade Volume: $100,000
- Commission Rate: 0.70% (0.0070)
- IB Share: 50%

```
Total Commission = $100,000 √ó 0.0070 = $700
IB Amount = $700 √ó 0.50 = $350
Admin Amount = $700 - $350 = $350
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Steps

1. **Set Global Defaults**
   - Go to "Global Settings" tab
   - Set default commission rate (e.g., 0.0070 for 0.70%)
   - Set default IB share (e.g., 50 for 50%)
   - Set min/max limits

2. **Customize Individual IBs**
   - Go to "IB List" tab
   - Click "Edit" on any IB
   - Adjust their specific share percentage
   - Must be within min/max limits
