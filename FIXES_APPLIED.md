## Backend Fixes Applied

### 1. IB Management Tab - Fixed ✅
**Issue**: IB users with no clients weren't showing in the IB Management panel
**Fix**: Modified `getAllIBsWithStats()` in `/backend/services/IntroducingBrokerService.js` to:
- Query users with 'IB' role from `user_roles` table
- Show all IB users even if they have no client relationships yet
- Default values for users with no activity:
  - Status: 'approved'
  - Tier: 'bronze'
  - Share: 50% (or from global settings)
  - Clients: 0
  - Commission: 0

**Result**: Your IB user (prabhat@test2.com) will now appear in the IB Management tab

### 2. Symbol Management Tab - Should Work ✅
**Database Check**: Confirmed 58 symbols exist and are active in database
- 20 samples shown: EURUSD, GBPUSD, BTCUSD, ETHUSD, etc.
- All symbols have `is_active = 1`
- 5 categories: FOREX_MAJOR, FOREX_MINOR, FOREX_EXOTIC, CRYPTO_MAJOR, COMMODITY

**Backend API**: Properly configured at `/admin/symbols`
- Returns symbols with pagination
- Supports filtering by category, search, status
- Proper response format with `success` and `data`

**If symbols still don't appear, the issue is likely**:
1. Frontend not loading (restart the dev server)
2. Authentication issue (make sure you're logged in as admin)
3. API URL misconfiguration

## Next Steps to Test

1. **Restart backend server**:
   ```
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Restart frontend**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Login as admin** and check:
   - IB Management tab should show prabhat@test2.com
   - Symbol Management tab should show all 58 symbols

4. **If still not working**, check browser console for errors (F12)
